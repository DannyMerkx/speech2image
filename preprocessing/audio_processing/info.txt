My own costum implementation of audio-feature extraction for raw audio frames, frequency spectrum, mel filterbanks and MFCC features. 

This was replaced with the librosa package in April 2020. If for whatever reason you cannot use this package, edit audio_features.py to import all functions in aud_feat_functions.py and you should be able to simply replace the python_speech_features function calls with the functions in that script. My scripts depend on the scipy, numpy and math packages. 

Slight implementation differences yield different results but testing showed the features generated by this implementation work just as well.
